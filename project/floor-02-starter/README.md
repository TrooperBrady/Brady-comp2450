# Floor 2 Starter — *The Sorting Crucible*

> **Catch-up copy — the code here is already complete.** The TODOs described below are filled in. Read the instructions, then read the code that satisfies them.

This is the Floor 2 starter for **COMP 2450 — The Descent**. Drop the contents into a new folder; this starter is **self-contained** and includes a reference version of your Floor 1 search code so the Bestiary still works while you focus on sorting this week.

You now have **one program** — `the_descent` — that does everything you've unlocked so far.

## What this program does — once you finish your work

```
=== THE SORTING CRUCIBLE ===

What is your name, adventurer? Aldric

Welcome back, Aldric.
Your trophies from Floor 1 are heaped on the floor, unsorted.
The forge at the center of the Crucible burns hot.

(commands:
   search <name>                 — look up a monster in the bestiary
   list                          — list the bestiary
   inventory                     — list your inventory
   sort inventory by <key> [asc|desc]
                                 — key is name, weight, or value
   benchmark [N]                 — race the search algorithms
   benchmark sort [N] [--sorted] [--bad-pivot]
                                 — race the sorting algorithms
   help                          — this screen
   quit                          — leave the dungeon)

   4.  Loaf of bread     (wt 0.1, val 1)

The forge dies down to embers.
```

Until you finish Floor 2, the sort commands will appear to do nothing — `sort inventory by weight` prints "Unknown sort key" (because `sortInventory` returns `false` from its stub) and every `benchmark sort` column reports 0.000 ms for your two sorts (because they are empty).

## What's already here (do not edit)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `main.cpp`                  | CLI loop — parses every command, calls into your sort |
| `bestiary/*`                | The Floor 1 bestiary — loader, search, benchmark. `Search.cpp` is the reference version. |
| `hero/Item.h`               | The `Item` struct |
| `hero/Hero.h / Hero.cpp`    | Hero struct, inventory loader, `printInventory` |
| `hero/Sort.h`               | Interface — three function declarations + `Comparator` typedef |
| `hero/Bench.h / Bench.cpp`  | `benchmark sort` harness (synthetic inventory, timing, `--sorted` / `--bad-pivot` options) |
| `data/monsters.txt`         | Floor 1 bestiary (15 monsters) |
| `data/starter-inventory.txt` | Floor 2 starting inventory (5 items, intentionally unsorted, with a deliberate weight tie) |
| `Makefile`                  | Build target `the_descent` |

## What you write

Open **`hero/Sort.cpp`** — it has three TODOs.

1. **`mergeSort(inventory, cmp)`** — stable, O(n log n) always. Split [lo, hi) in two, recurse, merge. (Monday)
2. **`quicksort(inventory, cmp)`** — in-place, O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst. Use the **middle element** as your pivot to avoid the Pivot Wraith on sorted input. (Wednesday)
3. **`sortInventory(hero, criterion)`** — parse the string (`"weight"`, `"name desc"`, `"value asc"`), build the right comparator, dispatch to a sort of your choice. Defend your pick in the Friday commit message. (Friday)

That is all the code you write this week. The rest of the game calls only through `Sort.h`, so the moment your three functions work, `sort inventory by …` works, `benchmark sort` produces real numbers, and your Lab 2 deliverable is one command away.

## Build & run

```
cmake -B build            # configure once (and any time CMakeLists.txt changes)
cmake --build build       # compile
./build/the_descent       # run (macOS / Linux)
build\the_descent.exe     # run (Windows cmd.exe)
```

The CMake build automatically copies `data/monsters.txt` and `data/starter-inventory.txt` next to the binary, so you can launch from either `build/` or the project root.

To wipe the build and start clean: `rm -rf build` (or delete the `build/` folder from your file manager) and re-run the two commands above.

## Demo target (Friday)

You should be able to type — in **one session of one binary**:

- `search Goblin` → goblin's stats (Floor 1 still works)
- `inventory` → 5 items, the order above
- `sort inventory by weight` → ascending weight (Iron key stays before Loaf of bread — stability!)
- `sort inventory by name desc` → reverse alphabetical
- `sort inventory by value` → ascending value
- `benchmark sort 10000` → three timing columns, non-zero
- `benchmark sort --sorted` → the full sweep on pre-sorted input
- `benchmark sort --sorted --bad-pivot` → the Pivot Wraith (run a small N first; this one gets SLOW)

## Lab 2 — *Race the Sorts* (folded into the project)

There is no separate lab handout this week. The `benchmark sort` command is the lab.

**Deliverable:** a `lab-notes.md` file under `floor-02/` in your project repo, containing:

1. The full `benchmark sort` sweep output (paste from your terminal).
2. **At what inventory size does `std::sort` clearly pull ahead** of your hand-rolled sorts? Read your table; pick a row.
3. **Run with `--sorted`.** Which sort gets faster? Which gets slower? *Why?*
4. **Run `benchmark sort --sorted --bad-pivot` at N=10,000.** What does the time for `quicksort*` look like? Compare to your middle-pivot run. This is the Pivot Wraith.
5. **One-paragraph reflection.** If you could only ship one of the three sorts in production, which would you ship? Defend your choice in terms of *worst case*, *average case*, and *what the data is likely to look like*.

Commit `lab-notes.md` along with your code. Your commit history should show at least three commits this week — Mon (merge), Wed (quick), Fri (`std::sort` wiring + lab notes).

## If you get stuck

- **`sort` says "Unknown sort key"** — your `sortInventory` returned `false`. Either it didn't recognize the key, or the stub still returns false.
- **Merge sort hangs / infinite-loops** — your recursion's base case or split is wrong. Base case for the half-open `[lo, hi)` form is `hi - lo < 2`.
- **Merge sort produces the wrong order** — the classic bug is writing `if (cmp(v[i], v[j]))` instead of `if (!cmp(v[j], v[i]))` at the "take from left half" branch. The second form is the one that preserves stability on ties.
- **Quicksort segfaults or hangs on an empty inventory** — early return when `v.size() < 2`. Lomuto partition's closed range `[lo, hi]` breaks on empty.
- **Quicksort crashes near `p - 1` when p == 0** — `std::size_t` is unsigned; `0 - 1` wraps. Guard with `if (p > lo) quicksortImpl(v, lo, p - 1, cmp);`.
- **`benchmark sort` prints 0.000 ms for all three columns** — your mergeSort and quicksort are still stubs. That's expected until you write them.

Bring any error you can't defeat to Wednesday's class.
